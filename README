STaRS - A Scalable Task Routing approach to distributed Scheduling
------------------------------------------------------------------

STaRS is a distributed scheduler of bag-of-tasks applications. It creates a
P2P overlay for the distribution of tasks among execution nodes, following
arbitrary policies. Its main goal is to reach scales not provided by any other
similar project.

It is currently in pre-Alpha stage, only simulation is possible.

Compilation
===========

STaRS depends on the following software:

- CMake 2.6 or higher
- Boost libs 1.46 or higher
- libLog4CPP
- MsgPack (tested with v. 0.5.7)

Optionally, some parts are also compiled with the following software:

- SimGrid 3.6 or higher
- Wt 3.2 or higher

The build system uses a mix of GNU make and CMake. CMake should be able to
find the required libraries if they are in common locations, like /usr or
/usr/local. In order to build a certain CMake build type, you can type the
usual:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=type
$ make

or just use the Makefile in the main directory and issue:

$ make CONFIG=type

This is the same as:

$ mkdir -p build/type
$ cd build/type
$ cmake ../.. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=type
$ make

In this way, different build types can be built at the same time.
This Makefile has been included in order to provide compatibility with
Eclipse CDT. Just create a Makefile project and set the correct CONFIG
variable for each build configuration.


Usage
=====

TODO


Simulation
==========

Two simulators are provided, a custom sequential simulator and an
experimental SimGrid based simulator. The later is not finished yet
and lacks many features.

The custom simulator is located in the oldsim directory. It is invoked with
the command:

$ stars-oldsim config_file

The config_file is a file with a set of properties in the form of key=value,
one per line. The special key case_name defines the case to be executed. Then,
each case has some specific properties and the rest are common to the
simulation platform. See the examples for further explanation.

The sweeper command can be used to launch a set of parameter sweep simulations.
It is invoked as:

$ sweeper -c config_file [-p num_proc] [-e simulator_exe] [-m max_memory]

The config_file file is similar to the configuration file of the simulator,
but special notation is used to assign lists and sequences of values to a
single key. The sweeper command generates a simulator configuration file for
each each possible combination. The simulator_exe program is used to launch
the simulations; if it is missing, only the configuration files are generated.
Finally, num_proc stablishes the number of parallel simulator processes to
launch at the same time, and max_memory is the maximum physical memory that
can be used by all the processes at the same time. See the examples for
further explanation.
