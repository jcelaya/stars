- Solve BUG: serialization
- Memory and disk properties are not persistent. They should be present in the platform xml, or otherwise they could be optionally saved in the network state file.
- Add the rest of the statistics to the simulator: traffic and availability. Traffic is included in the simulation engine, I expect...
- Add the perfect scheduler
- Add the failure generator: it should be procedural and not part of the platform description
