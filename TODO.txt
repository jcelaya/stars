Lib:
- Remove the use of exceptions

Sweeper:
- Rewrite with better file syntax
- Use wildcards for filename substitution
- Create dependencies between cases
- Relate a parameter to another one

Old simulator:
- Beware with common file paths, like siteLevel traces

SimGrid based simulator:
- Memory and disk properties are not persistent. They should be present in the platform xml, or otherwise they could be optionally saved in the network state file.
- Add the rest of the statistics to the simulator: traffic and availability. Traffic is included in the simulation engine, I expect...
- Add the perfect scheduler
- Add the failure generator: it should be procedural and not part of the platform description

All:
- Documentation, comments and Doxygen
